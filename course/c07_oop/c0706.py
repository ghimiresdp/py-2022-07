Types of methods:
- Bound
    - bound to the instance
    - bound to the class
- Unbound

# Class Methods and static methods

Class Methods
- Class methods are special kind of methods that are bound to the class instead of the instance
- If we create an instance and change the property of the object, it is not going to affect the property
  of the classmethod.

Static Methods
- Static methods are methods that do not bind to anything at all and simply return the underlying function
  without any transformation.
- They just behave like a function. Only the difference is they are called along with the class name.
